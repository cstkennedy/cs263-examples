# Part 2

The Part 2 recording is available [here](https://youtu.be/C8lobDIZUoY).

Example 3 is an example of a CS 250 level Objected Oriented Program in Java
(instead of C++).

  - This includes a brief discussion of Gradle and JUnit as topics of
    interest.
  - Gradle and JUnit are CS 350 topics that are related to CS 330. You will
    not be graded on Gradle or JUnit in CS 330.
